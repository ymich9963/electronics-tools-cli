# Electronics Tools CLI
FOSS CLI tool for a variety of tools used in electronics design.

## Contents
`twc` - Trace Width Calculator, using IPC-2512 and IPC-2221. Calculate the trace widths for the required current in the trace.

## Why
Good question! I'm not really sure...I started this project as practice to start coding something and expand my knowledge of C CLI tooling. I noticed there aren't any open source electronics related tools (except the KiCAD calculator), and I thought it might be cool to create some and allow other people to contribute and maybe get something going.
